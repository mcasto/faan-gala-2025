  <div>
    This year, our gala will once again be held at Estancia Rosario. It will
    focus on funding the new physical shelter located in Tarqui.
  </div>

  <div>
    Our dogs have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
    <em>Frankly, my dears, we <strong>DO Give a Damn</strong></em> about the
    shelter dog's welfare. This new shelter will provide our photogenic pups
    with an opportunity to improve their living conditions. They have been under
    the loving care of Jose, the leader of the pack, but it's time to be
    homeward-bound in a beautiful new facility while awaiting their forever
    homes.
  </div>

  <div>
    They are ready for their close-ups, and we cannot wait.
  </div>

  <div>
    Join us in this opportunity to provide a wonderful life for our charismatic
    canines.
