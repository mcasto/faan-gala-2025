  <div>
    Thank you Cuenca Friends for joining us at FAAN's Gala FAAN-TASTICA VIP
    Private Event for our Friends and Animal Lovers.
  </div>

  <div>
    There will be no public admission to this star-studded night where we gather
    to raise funds to build the new and modern animal shelter. We can't wait to
    see you in all of your glamour on the Red Carpet
  </div>

  <div>
    For Barry and I, this is a very special evening as we together celebrate our
    150th Birthday next week (Yes, we added them together.) Rather than a
    private birthday, we opted for a big "PAW-TY" to help build Cuenca's most
    vulnerable dogs, their new home.
  </div>

  <div>
    So we'll see you on Saturday and if you can't join us, feel free to join us
    at the Ungala Gala and Art and Silent Auction/
  </div>

  <div>
    Gracias Amigos de Animales
