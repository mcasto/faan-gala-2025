    On October 7, 2023, Ecuador's Animal Loving Community came together to raise
    critical funds to purchase permanent land for FAAN's new US Standard Animal
    Sanctuary in Ecuador at Cuenca's Charity Gala of the Year! Voted by Gringo
    Post at the Best Charity Event. Thanks to you, we’re ready to build!
